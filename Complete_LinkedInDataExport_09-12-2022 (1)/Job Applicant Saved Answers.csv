Cover letter," I am writing this letter to express my deep interest in applying for the Machine Learning Role at Neural Magic. As an ambitious professional with developed skills and extensive experience, I was thrilled to learn about the opening. I was compelled to contact you with my interest to be considered for such an opportunity. I believe that my professional background and industrialist drive make me an ideal candidate to fill this position. Firstly, I am a second year Master student in Computer Science at Syracuse University where I received the Fulbright Scholarship from Afghanistan. I am currently holding a 3.833 GPA which I aim to improve much further in the upcoming semesters. Moreover, I am currently working on research involving Artificial Intelligence in detecting fraud in Unemployment Insurance with one of the top professors at our university, which has led me to become proficient in applying machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Regression and classification models. I code my machine learning models using Python with libraries including, but not limited to, pandas, scikit-learn and NumPy. My interest in software development and machine learning stemmed from my passion in promoting transparency within corrupt governments. I have been active in consistently learning new models and tools every day since.  I graduated from International Islamic University Malaysia as the first female Afghan Valedictorian in the Bachelor of Computer Science. I am an extremely dedicated and hardworking individual with a diverse background and have learned how to work with people from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. In Afghanistan, I worked in one of the top IT Companies names Netlinks LTD as a project coordinator for the Software team. I worked on developing a business directory for Afghanistanâ€™s Renewable Energy Union Association and on a Times Magazine Featured mobile application named Ehtesab, which focused on providable technology solutions to serve the needs of communities who reside within Afghanistan. Furthermore, I also worked in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as a software engineer where we developed Human Resource Management Systems and Visitor Management Systems.  As an Afghan woman who's worked hard throughout my life despite the obstacles, I will continuously work hard if you give me the opportunity to do so. If you choose to interview and hire me, you will not be disappointed. What a thrill it would be to work for your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
